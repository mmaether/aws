# AWS Certified Solutions Architect

This repo will hold notes and project updates as I go through the Udemy AWS Certified Solutions Architect. I expect most of this repo to contain various notes that I'll be able to look back on at any point, but it's good to have a repo to track all progress regardless.

- files: Any files created for testing purposes, e.g. uploading a test file to a bucket.
- notes: This folder lists all notes I've jotted as I've been going through the course.
