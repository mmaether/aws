# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam Preparation

## IT

AWS Service Catalog: Using cloud resources, it can be frustrating making sure everyone has appropriately levels of access. This helps IT administrators organize, govern, and distribute application stacks or products using CloudFormation templates.

AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF): help organizations design and travel an accelerated path to successful cloud adoption

## Databases

Amazon Aurora: Amazon flavor of MySQL-type databases, optimized for the cloud. 

Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible relational database built for the cloud, that combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases. Aurora is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases. It provides the security, availability, and reliability of commercial-grade databases at 1/10th the cost. Aurora is fully managed by Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), which automates time-consuming administration tasks like hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.

Amazon Neptune: A graph database service.

## Big Data

Amazon EMR: Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is a web service that enables businesses, researchers, data analysts, and developers to easily and cost-effectively process vast amounts of data across dynamically scalable Amazon EC2 instances.


Which of the following EC2 instance purchasing options supports the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model for almost every BYOL scenario?

Dedicated Hosts are most cost effective when the host is highly utilized and in a steady, non-variable state. A Dedicated Host will support the BYOL scenarios outlined in this FAQ and provide customers with more control and visibility over how their instances are placed, which is useful for minimizing risk and licensing costs in a BYOL scenario. Additionally, Dedicated Hosts support per-socket, per-core, VM, and CAL based licenses. Windows is the most common product brought to Dedicated Hosts.

Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2, so that you get the flexibility and cost effectiveness of using your own licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirements.

## Compute

Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

AWS Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of TCP and TLS traffic.



## Networking

AWS Direct Connect: AWS Direct Connect is used to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your data center, office, or co-location environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.

Network ACLs is used to control traffic at the subnet level.

## Security

AWS WAF: AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define.
