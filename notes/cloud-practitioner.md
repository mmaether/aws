## Cloud Computing Models

Model | Description
----- | -----------
**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** | Most similar to existing IT resources. Tools for cloud IT and access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage.
**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** | Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you donâ€™t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
**Software as a Service (SaaS)** | Build applications in the cloud.
